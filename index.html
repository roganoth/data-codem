    <p>I am a person that enjoys facing a challenge and overcoming it. I love a good story enjoy the ride it takes me on. My favorite way of expressing these joys is through TTRPG's such as Dungeons and Dragons, and learning new board games - which are plenty in this time of the Board Game Renaissance.</p>

    <p>Taking on the challenges of learning and experiencing a story that we are making is the most fun I have with my closest group of friends. Wether it be plunging into dark catacombs and dungeons for treasure or saving a world on the brink of destruction, these are some of my fondest memories.</p>

    <p>But my love of learning and being challenged does not end at the gaming table - no, it is also what lead me to learning to code. Everything new I learn, every challenge I face is exhilirating. Challenge is my passion.</p>
